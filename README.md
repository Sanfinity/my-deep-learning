# My Deep Learning

Welcome to **my-deep-learning** repository! 🚀 This is my personal space where I learn, explore, and implement various deep learning concepts, with a special focus on **Large Language Models (LLMs)** from scratch.

## 📌 Overview
This repository serves as a collection of my notes, implementations, and experiments related to deep learning and LLMs. It covers key topics such as:

- Basics of Neural Networks
- Backpropagation and Optimization Techniques
- Transformer Architecture
- Attention Mechanisms
- Training and Fine-tuning LLMs
- Experimenting with Small-Scale Language Models

## 📂 Repository Structure
```
my-deep-learning/
│── notebooks/          # Jupyter notebooks with implementations & experiments
│── src/               # Source code for custom models and utilities
│── data/              # Sample datasets (if applicable)
│── models/            # Saved models and checkpoints
│── docs/              # Learning notes and explanations
│── requirements.txt   # Dependencies for running the code
│── README.md          # This file
```

## 🚀 Getting Started
To set up the environment and start experimenting, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-deep-learning.git
   cd my-deep-learning
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run Jupyter Notebook** (if using notebooks for learning)
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## 📖 Learning Resources
Some resources I’m following to learn about LLMs:
- [Attention Is All You Need (Vaswani et al.)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)
- [The Illustrated Transformer by Jay Alammar](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/)
- [Andrej Karpathy’s Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ3M8zq3Z8QwHS2JP1ZLO-RvUmycwHEN_)

## 🤝 Contributing
This is primarily a learning project, but if you find anything interesting or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue or a pull request!

## 📜 Notes
- Always give the prompt properly while infering the model

Happy Learning! 🚀
